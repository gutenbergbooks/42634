EPITAPHS ON MEN.


An old American epitaph:

    Under this sod, and under these trees,
    Lieth the body of Samuel Pease;
    He is not in this hole, but only his pod,
    He shelled out his soul and went up to God.

       *       *       *       *       *

Another version:

    Under this sod, beneath these trees,
    Lyeth the pod of Solomon Pease.
    Pease is not here, but only his pod,
    He shelled out his soul, which went straight to his God.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies the body of Johnny Haskell
    A lying, thieving, cheating rascal;
    He always lied, and now he lies,
    He has no soul and cannot rise.

       *       *       *       *       *

An Irishman wrote the following oft-quoted lines for his epitaph:

    Here I lays,
    Paddy O'Blase;
    My body quite at its aise is,
    With the tip of my nose
    And the points of my toes
    Turned up to the roots of the daisies.

       *       *       *       *       *

In Ballyporen (Ire.) churchyard, on Teague O'Brian, written by himself:

    Here I at length repose,
    My spirit now at aise is;
    With the tips of my toes
    And the point of my nose
    Turned up to the roots of the daisies.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies Richard Fothergill who met a violent death. He was
    shot by a colt's revolver, old kind, brass mounted, and of such is
    the kingdom of heaven.

       *       *       *       *       *

A Cornwall churchyard is enriched with the following dainty verses:

    Here lies entombed one Roger Morton,
    Whose sudden death was early brought on;
    Trying one day his corn to mow off,
    The razor slipped and cut his toe off.

    The toe, or rather what it grew to,
    An inflammation quickly flew to;
    The parts they took to mortifying,
    And poor dear Roger took to dying.

       *       *       *       *       *

    The death angel struck Alexander McGlue
    And gave him protracted repose;
    He wore a checked shirt and a No. 9 shoe
    And had a pink wart on his nose.

    No doubt he is happy a-dwelling in space
    Over on the evergreen shore.
    His friends are informed that his funeral takes place
    At precisely a quarter past four.

       *       *       *       *       *

At Brightwell, Oron. On S. Rumbold, born February, 1582:

    He lived one hundred and five,
    Sanguine and strong;
    A hundred to five,
    You live not so long.
    Dy'd March 4, 1687.

       *       *       *       *       *

    This is all that remains of poor Ben Hough
    He had forty-nine years and that was enough.
    Of worldly goods he had his share,
    And now he's gone to the Devil's snare.

       *       *       *       *       *

In an old cemetery in Lyme, Conn.:

    Close behind this stone
    Here lies alone
    Captain Reynolds Marvin,
    Expecting his wife
    When ends her life,
    And we both are freed from sarvin'.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies the body of Captain Gervase Scrope, of the family of
    the Scropes of Bilton, in the county of York, who departed this life
    26th August, Anno Domini 1705, aged 66.

    An epitaph written by himself, in the agony and doloroes paines
    of the gout, and died soon after.

    Here lies an old toss'd tennis ball.
    Was racketted from spring to fall.
    With so much heat and so much frost,
    Time's arms for shame grew ty'rd at last.
    Four kings in camps he truly served,
    And from his loyalty ne'er swerved.
    Father ruin'd, the son slighted,
    And from the Crown ne'er requited.
    Loss of Estate, Relations, Blood,
    Was too well known, but did no good.
    With long campaigns and paines o' th' Gout,
    He could no longer hold it out.
    Always a restless life he led,
    Never at quiet till quite dead.
    He married in his latter days
    One who exceeds the common praise;
    But wanting health still to make known
    Her true affection and his own,
    Death kindly came, all wants supply'd,
    By giving Rest which life deny'd.

       *       *       *       *       *

From a tombstone near Williamsport, Penn.:

                        Sacred to the Memory of
                             HENRY HARRIS,
                 Born June 27th, 1821, of Henry Harris
                           And Jane his Wife.
   Died on the 4th of May, 1837, by the kick of a colt in his bowels.

    Peaceable and quiet, a friend to his father and mother, and
    respected by all who knew him, and went to the world where horses
    don't kick, where sorrow and weeping is no more.

       *       *       *       *       *

    YATTENDON BERKS. 1770.

    O Death, thy call was soon,
      My pains were smart,
    But I, prepared,
      Was ready to depart
    In hopes to Heaven, there to sit
      With Saints and Angels bright,
    Singing Hallelujahs
      In which I took delight.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Tread softly mortals o'er the bones
    Of this world's wonder, Captain Jones,
    Who told his glorious deeds to many
    Yet never was believed by any.
    Posterity let this suffice
    He swore all's true, yet here he lies.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies the body of John Bidwell,
    Who, when in life, wished his neighbors no evil.
      In hopes up to jump
      When he hears the last trump
    And triumph over Death and the Devil.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies David Garrick, describe me who can,
    An abridgement of all that was pleasant in man.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Beneath this stone of granite hard
    Lies my own beloved pard.

       *       *       *       *       *

    ON A MR. PECK

    Here lies a Peck, which some men say
    Was first of all a Peck of clay;
    This wrought with skill divine, while fresh,
    Became a curious Peck of flesh.
    Through various forms its Maker ran,
    Then adding breath made Peck a man;
    Full fifty years Peck felt life's troubles
    Till death relieved a Peck of troubles;
    Then fell poor Peck, as all things must.
    And here he lies,--a Peck of dust.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies John Hill, a man of skill,
      His age was five times ten,
    He ne'er did good, nor ever would,
      Had he lived as long again

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies the body of John Smith. Had he lived till he got
    ashore, he would have been buried here.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies Dr. Trollope,
    Who made these stones roll up;
    He took a dose of jalop,
    And God took his soul up.

       *       *       *       *       *

    John Macpherson
    Was a remarkable person;
      He stood six feet two
      Without his shoe,
      And he was slew
      At Waterloo.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies John Auricular,
    Who in the ways of the Lord walked perpendicular.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Don't weep for me, my wife most dear,
      But still remember I lie here,
    Altho' cut down when little past my bloom,
      Shed not one tear upon my tomb.

       *       *       *       *       *

From Harrow Churchyard :

    In memory of Mr. John Port, son of Mr. Thomas Port, of
    Burton-on-Trent, who, not far from this town, had both his legs
    severed from his body by the Railway Train. With greatest fortitude
    he bore a second amputation by the surgeons, and died from loss of
    blood.

    Bright rose the morn, and vigorous rose poor Port,
    Gay on the train he used his wonted sport.
    When noon arrived, a mangled form they bore,
    With pain distorted and o'erwhelmed with gore.
    When evening came to close the fatal day,
    A mutilated corpse the sufferer lay.

       *       *       *       *       *

A miser:

    Here lies one who for medicine would not give
      A little gold, and so his life he lost:
    I fancy now he'd wish again to live
      Could he but guess how much his funeral cost.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies the body of Jonathan Near
    Whose mouth it stretched from ear to ear.
    Tread softly, stranger, o'er this wonder,
    For if he yawns, you're gone, by thunder!

       *       *       *       *       *

Truro, Nova Scotia:

    Don't weep for me, Eliza dear,
    I am not dead, but sleeping here.
    As I am now so you must be,
    Prepare for death and follow me.

    OLIVER P. DONNALLY.

    A son that has been ever kind
    Has gone and left us all behind;
    Cease to weep, my Mother dear,
    For I am wrapped up and lying here.
    Dear Oliver has gone to rest
    In Heaven above with Angels blest;
    A place is vacant at our hearts.
    Which never can be filled.

       *       *       *       *       *

From Banbury Churchyard:

    To the memory of Ric. Richards, who by a Gangreen first lost a
    Toe, afterwards a Leg, and lastly his Life on the 7th day of April,
    1656.

    Ah! cruel Death, to make 3 Meals of one!
    To taste and eat, and Eat 'till all was gone.
    But know, thou Tyrant! when the Trump shall call,
    He'll find his Feet, and stand when thou shalt fall.

       *       *       *       *       *

    who died the 21st February, 1778, aged 17 years.

    And his son John of honest fame,
    Of stature small and a leg lame;
    Content he was with portion small,
    Keeped shop in Wigtown, and that's all.
    Died August 21st, 1779, aged 32 years.

       *       *       *       *       *

    The only _surviving_ son of
      Admiral Vernon.

       *       *       *       *       *

In New Hampshire:

      By trade a bum.
    When Caleb dyed the Devil cryed:
      "Come, Caleb, come."

       *       *       *       *       *

Lord Brougham (for an orator):

    Here, reader, turn your weeping eyes,
      My fate a useful moral teaches;
    The hole in which my body lies
      Would not contain one half my speeches.

       *       *       *       *       *

On a bachelor:

    At threescore winters' end I died,
      A cheerless being, sole and sad;
    The nuptial knot I never tied,
      And wish my father never had.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies the body of Henry Round
    Who went to sea and never was found.

       *       *       *       *       *

In Thetford Churchyard, Norfolk:

    My grandfather was buried here,
    My cousin Jane and two uncles dear;
    My father perished with an inflammation in his thighs
    And my sister dropped down dead in the Minories;
    But the reason why I'm here interr'd, according to my thinking,
    Is owing to my good living and hard drinking.
    If, therefore, good Christians, you wish to live long,
    Don't drink too much wine, brandy, gin, or anything strong.

       *       *       *       *       *

The celebrated Daniel Lambert's epitaph, St. Martin's, Stamford Baron,
England:

                 _Altus in animo, in corpore maximus._

               In remembrance of that prodigy in Nature,

                            DANIEL LAMBERT.

   A native of Leicester, who was possessed of an exalted, convivial
                                 mind;
              and in personal greatness had no competitor;
  He measured 3 ft. 1 in. round the legs, 9 ft. 4 in. round the body,
                       and weighed 52 st. 11 lb.

             He departed this life on the 21st June, 1809,
                             Aged 39 years.

    As a testimony of respect, this stone is erected by his friend
    in Leicester.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Man's life's a vapor, and full of woes,
    He cuts a caper, and down he goes.

       *       *       *       *       *

John Knott, of Sheffield, England:

    Here lies a man that was Knott born,
    His father was Knott before him,
    He lived Knott, and did Knott die,
    Yet underneath this stone doth lie.

       *       *       *       *       *

In a French cemetery there are the following concise inscriptions on one

An old man:

    Lively I walked life's journey through
    Till I arrived at eighty-two;
    Then calm descended here to rest
    In hopes to be forever blest.

       *       *       *       *       *

Hackett to the author of Dr. Mead's epitaph:

    Mead's not dead then, you say, only sleeping a little;
    Why, egad, sir, you've hit it off there to a tittle;
    Yet, friend, his awaking I very much doubt--
    Pluto knows who he's got, and will ne'er let him out.

       *       *       *       *       *

Oldtown, Maine:

    ORONO, AN INDIAN CHIEF, 1801.

    Safe lodg'd within his blanket, here below,
    Lie the last relics of old Orono;
    Worn down with toil and care, he in a trice
    Exchang'd his wigwam for a paradise.

       *       *       *       *       *

From St. Philip's Churchyard, Birmingham:

    To the memory of James Baker, who died January 27th, 1781.

    O cruel Death, how cou'd you be so unkind
    To take him before and leave me behind?
    You should have taken both of us, if either,
    Which would have been more pleasing to the survivor.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Died, on the 14th inst., Henry Wilkins Glyn, aged 3 days and
    7 hours. After a long and painful illness, which he bore with
    Christian fortitude, this youthful martyr departed to his rest.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies the body of Jonathan Stout.
    He fell in the water and never got out,
    And still is supposed to be floating about.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies one Box within another;
          The one of wood
          Was very good;
    We cannot say so much for t' other.




Epitaphs on Women.


An epitaph from an Irish graveyard:

    Here lies the body of Lady O'Looney,
      Grand-niece to Edmund Burke,
      Commonly called "the sublime."
    She was bland, passionate, and religious,
                Also,
    She painted in water-colors.
                Also,
    She sent several articles to the Exhibition.
      She was first cousin to Lady Jones.
    And of such is the kingdom of heaven.
                                      Amen.

       *       *       *       *       *

At St. Albans:

    Sacred to the memory of Miss Martha Gwynn,
    Who was so very pure within,
    She burst the outer shell of sin,
    And hatched herself a cherubim.

       *       *       *       *       *

There is an epitaph of an eccentric character that may be seen on a
tombstone at the burying-grounds near Hoosick Falls, New York. It reads:

    Ruth Sprague, Daughter of Gibson and Elizabeth Sprague. Died
    June 11, 1846, aged 9 years, 4 months, and 3 days.

    She was stolen from the grave by Roderick R. Clow, dissected at
    Dr. P. M. Armstrong's office, in Hoosick, N. Y., from which place
    her mutilated remains were obtained and deposited here.

    Her body dissected by fiendish man,
      Her bones anatomized,
    Her soul, we trust, has risen to God,
      Where few physicians rise.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies the body of Sarah Sexton,
    Who as a wife did never vex one.
    We can't say that for her at the next stone.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here lies the body of Ann Mann,
    Who lived an old woman,
    And died an old Mann.

       *       *       *       *       *

Epitaph on Lady Molesworth. Burnt to death 6 May, 1763:

    A peerless matron, pride of female life
    In every state, as widow, maid, or wife;
    Who wedded, to threescore preserved her fame,
    She lived a phoenix, and expired in flame.

       *       *       *       *       *

A Welsh husband thus sings above the grave of his better-half:

    This spot is the sweetest I've seen in my life,
    For it raises my flowers and covers my wife.

       *       *       *       *       *

At Wolstanton:

    MRS. ANN JENNINGS.

    Some have children, some have none;
    Here lies the mother of twenty-one.

       *       *       *       *       *

    This corpse
    Is Phoebe Thorp's.

In memory of the "Wigtown Martyrs:"

    Here lyes Margrat Willson, Doughter of Gilbert Willson, in
    Glenvernoch, who was Drowned Anno 1685, age 18.

    Head of his church and no more crime
    But not abjuring Presbytry

MRS. MARTHA GIFFORD, 1810.

    Sickness sore, long time I bore
      Physician's skill in vain,

From Smithfield, Rhode Island, 1796:

    While she was at a brook,
      And where she did not like to go,
    She from her friends was sudden took,
      Seized with a fit she's subject to.
    Her body in the water lay,
      Her weeping husband found the same,
    The means was used without delay
      To call her back, but all in vain.
    Her life to God she did resign,
      And angels bore her soul away.
    The grave her body now confines
      Shall rise triumphant the last day.

On an old woman who kept a pottery-shop in Chester, England:

    Beneath these stones lies old Kathering Gray,
    Changed from a busy life to lifeless clay;
    By earth and clay she got her pelf,
    But now is turned to earth herself.
    Ye weeping friends, let me advise,
    Abate your grief and dry your eyes,
    For what avails a flood of tears?
    Who knows but in a run of years,
    In some tall pitcher or bread pan,
    She in her shop may be again?

        When she lived long enough
        She made her last puff,
    A puff by her husband much praised,
        Now here she doth lie
        And makes a dirt pie,

    He ever was brisk, and tho' now gone to wreck,
    When he hears the last whistle, he'll jump upon deck.

           the outside Case of George Routleigh, Watchmaker.
             Integrity was the Mainspring, and prudence the
                               Regulator,
                    Of all the actions of his life.

                         his hand never stopped
                     till he had relieved distress.
               So nicely regulated were all his Motions,
                       that he never went wrong,
                        except when set a-going
                               by people
                       who did not know his Key:
                        Even then he was easily
                            set right again.
             He had the art of disposing his time so well,
                     that his Hours kept running on
                   in a continual round of pleasure,
                  till an unlucky Minute put a stop to
                             his existence.
                         He departed this life
                    in hopes of being taken in hand
                             by his Maker;
               and of being thoroughly Cleaned, Repaired,
                       Wound up, and Set a-going
                         in the world to come.

    My nails are drove, my work is done.

    That here he lies all bona fide.

    For she lived in a house where no help was hired;

    To a land where there's nothin' of washin' or sewin',
    And everything there shall be just to my wishes,

    But having no voice I'll get clear of the singin'."

    And whispered, "Oh nothin', sweet nothin forever."
